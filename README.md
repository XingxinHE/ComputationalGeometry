# Computational Geometry



### Welcome:wave:


<div align="center">God ever geometrizes. - PLATO </div>



Welcome to this repo. As the development of geometric deep learning and geometry processing, geometry is playing an ever-growing important role in the field of architecture, computational design, and robotic fabrication. Although I am able to write geometric algorithm from time to time, I aim to have a big and thorough picture over this topic. Therefore, I felt compelled to study computational geometry across different subject.

### StructureðŸ§©

In light of different sources of materials, this repo is organized as follows:

- Book:books:   the must read books
- Lecture:school:    the popular online lecture
- Library:computer:    the popular geometry processing library
- Paper:page_with_curl:    the must read paper
- Workshop:video_camera:  the short-period of workshop
