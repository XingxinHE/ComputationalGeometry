# Computational Geometry



### Welcome


<div align="center">God ever geometrizes. - PLATO </div>



Welcome to this repo. As the development of geometric deep learning and geometry processing, geometry is playing an ever-growing important role in the field of architecture, computational design, and robotic fabrication. Although I am able to write geometric algorithm from time to time, I aim to have a big and thorough picture over this topic. Therefore, I felt compelled to study computational geometry across different subject.
