## What's Real About Virtual Reality?

This is the article wrote by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. ,Turing Award recipient back in 1999.  When I think of the latest metaverse boom, I can't help admire his imagination and foresight. So what was his assessment of the state of the VR art which was an infant technology 20 years ago? 然后什么被解决了？

:pushpin::pushpin:Technologies

He pointed out 4 most crucial technologies and another 4 auxiliary techniques.

:star:The first 4 crucial are:

- Display📺
- Rendering Engine⚙
- Tracking System🖲
- Ergonomics🎧



:star: 



In the end, Prof. Brooks addressed the HOT open challenges.
