# 1. Reading Assignment



##### What is the solution of the research field of *Architectural Geometry* ?

___

Discrete Differential Geometry and Numerical Optimization. Also, it is the interdisciplinary research filed between mathematics and computer science.



##### What is *rationalization* and What is *panelization* ??

___

rationalization: The approximation of an ideal design surface by a surface which is suitable for fabrication.

panelization: Replace the design surface by a surface which has a simple generation like a ruled surface

Both are very similar.



##### What is fabrication-aware design?

___

A digital modeling tool which automatically generates only buildable structures of a certain type. 上述的rationalization是设计->工程转换的问题，是解决设计落地的问题。后者fabrication-aware design是直接输出落地的工程解决方案，没有转换过程。



##### What kind of topic includes?

___

Flat panels, Developable panels, Smooth double-curved skins, paneling, support structures, repetition, patterns, statics, shading and other functional aspects, design exploration







## 1.1 Polyhedral surfaces – structures from flat panels

建筑行业一般习惯把free-form的曲面拆分成很多小的板块，这些板块被称为*panel*， 那么将曲面拆分成panel的这种曲面被定义为polyhedral surfaces / polyhedral meshes



### 1.1.1 History of polyhedral surfaces in architecture

___

1928, engineers of Carl Zeiss, planetarium in Jena, Germany

Construction method: project the vertices of a platonic solid with regularly triangulated faces to a sphere

1940s, R. Buckminster Fuller, geodesic dome

Construction method: increase the stability of triangular elements



### 1.1.2 Triangle meshes from the architectural perspective

___

(1) Edges, mesh has different uses in Computer Graphics and Architecture. 

Graphics: 模糊的，用来rendering比较多，所以一般不会露出edges

Architecture: mesh edges is important for design

(2) Normal vector, this is kind of important for the gaussian image of the surface.

Hybrid triangle-quad mesh in the roof of Islamic art exhibition in the Louvre, Paris, by Mario Bellini Architects and Rudy Ricciott. 这种是最基础最基本的建筑结构，每一块面折成三角面，所以这种结构最能看出三角形的edges。



### 1.1.3 Planar quad meshes

___

Planar quad mesh = PQ Mesh

PQ Mesh in the roof of Hippo house. 它是平的，可以想象成是一根线sweep过它的曲面顶部。



##### What is conjugate?

___

$s(u,v)$ = parameterization of a surface

$n = (s_u\times s_v)/\lVert s_u\times s_v\rVert$ , unit normal field

$\begin{bmatrix}L&M\\M&N\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}s_{uu}\cdot n&s_{uv}\cdot n\\s_{uv}\cdot n&s_{vv}\cdot n\end{bmatrix}$, coefficient matrix

$t_1 = u_1s_u+v_1s_v$ , $t_2 = u_2s_u+v_2s_v$

If second fundamental form:
$$
(t_1, t_2) = Lu_1v_1 + M(u_1v_2 + u_2v_1) + Nu_2v_2 = 0
$$

Then we say $t_1,t_2$ are the conjugate. (principle curvature directions = conjugate direction when orthogonal)



So what if conjugate all about?

You can see it as the surface can be panelized once the surface is divided by conjugate curve.

The blue curves are generated by manually drawn guide-curve. The area of intersection between red curve and blue curve is nearly flat!! (a.k.a it is ok to fabricate)



But in most of the cases, **PQ Mesh** is mostly forced to use principal curvature line to remesh. You can easily sense the principal curvature direction along the roof in the following image

:warning:PQ Mesh is hard and easily failed to remesh surface like minimal surface马鞍面(which $t_1=-t_2$)!!



### 1.1.4 Nearly rectangular panels, support structures and offsets

Nearly rectangular panels are sustainable and preferable in fabrication since it saves lots of materials and energy. There are 2 types of these: ***Circular meshes*** and ***Conical meshes***.
