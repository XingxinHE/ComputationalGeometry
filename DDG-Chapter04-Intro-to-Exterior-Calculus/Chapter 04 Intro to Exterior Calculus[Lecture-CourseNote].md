# Chapter 04 Intro to Exterior Calculus

Reason to study Exterior Calculus:

- Language: used to interact with *signed volume*
- Geometry: algebraic geometry, geometric algebra
- Physics: velocity, acceleration, momentum, force
- Computer Science: geometric computation on meshes



To 100% understand ***Discrete Exterior Calculus***, the pipeline is organized as followed:

- Linear Algebra: "little arrows" (vectors)
- Vector Calculus: how do vectors change?
- Exterior Algebra: "little volumes" ($k$-vectors)
- Exterior Calculus: how do $k$-vectors change?
- ***Discrete Exterior Calculus***: How do we do all of this on meshes?



In a nutshell, similar to Discrete Differential Geometry is to replace Differential Geometry, ***Discrete Exterior Calculus*** also is to replace vector calculus with computation on meshes.



Built on ***DEC***, the computational tools are:

## Vector Spaces

(fml.) A vector space is a set $V$ together with the operations

Addition:  $+: V\times V\to V$

Scalar multiplication:  $\cdot: \mathbb{R}\times V\to V$



Must satisfy the following properties for all vectors $x,y,z$ and scalars $a,b$:
